Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a video game in C++ and a simulated router app made in Go and React!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Linux, and Docker, with a dash of AWS Cloud Practitioner and sprinkle Network+.
I have experience in AWS, Azure, containerizing apps with Docker, CI/CD Pipelines and some networking.
But I am gaining a more in-depth education on these topics for my own confidence in them as well as certifications!

âœ¨ In a couple months I start an online Cornell Univeristy certification course in Python.
Spreading myself as thin as the last scrapings of jam for a big piece of toast!
