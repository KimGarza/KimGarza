Hi there ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a video game in C++ and a simulated router app made in Go and React!

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Linux, and Docker, with a dash of AWS Cloud Practitioner and sprinkle Network+.
Spreading myself as thin as the last scrapings of jam for a big piece of toast!
